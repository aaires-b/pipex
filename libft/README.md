# Libft - Your Library of Custom C Functions

## Introduction

HI! This is my **libft** project at 42 school ! The aim of **libft** is to build your  first own library of useful C functions that you will be able to use in all your future C projects at 42. 

## Project Description

In this project, you are tasked with creating a C library that includes a variety of custom functions, including those found in the standard C library (libc). Your **Libft** should be able to replace or, in some cases, add some functionalities to the standard library functions, and it should carefully tested.

### String Manipulation

String manipulation is a core aspect of C programming, and it's essencial for tasks like processing text, parsing data, and interacting with user inputs. In **libft** , string manipulation functions are consolidated to help you throughout the hole course.

Key string manipulation functions in **libft** include:

- **ft_strlen** : Calculate the length of a string.
- **ft_strcpy** : Copy one string to another.
- **ft_strcmp** : Compare two strings.
- **ft_strdup** : Duplicate a string, allocating memory for the new copy.

These functions will help you to understand how to handle strings and create your own custom string functions as needed.

### Memory Allocation

Memory allocation  allows you to manage and utilize memory efficiently. The **libft** library provides memory allocation functions to help you understand the fundamentals of dynamic memory management.

Key memory allocation functions in **libft** include:

- **ft_memset:** Fill a block of memory with a specific value.
- **ft_memcpy** : Copy data from one memory location to another.
- **ft_memmove** : Copies a block of memory from one location to another, even if the source and destination memory regions overlap, ensuring data integrity.
- **ft_memcmp** : Compares two blocks of memory and returns zero if they are equal, a negative value if the first block is less than the second, or a positive value if the first block is greater than the second, making it useful for binary data comparisons.

This project teaches you how to allocate memory for variables, initialize memory with specific values, and release memory resources when they are no longer needed. This knowledge is essencial for creating efficient and reliable C programs.

### List management

In the **libft** library, thereâ€™s a panoply of functions that help you understand and work with linked lists, a versatile data structure for organizing and storing data.

Key list management functions in **libft** include:

- **ft_lstnew** : Create a new linked list node.
- **ft_lstadd_front:** Add a node to the beginning of a linked list.
- **ft_lstsize:** Get the size (number of nodes) of a linked list.
- **ft_lstiter:** Iterate through a linked list, applying a function to each node.
- **ft_lstmap**: Create a new list resulting from applying a function to each node in an existing list.

Understanding list management is crucial for more advanced data structures and algorithms. By getting used to list management with libft, you'll gain more skills for working with complex data structures in future projects.
